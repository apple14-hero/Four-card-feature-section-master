## My process
Firstly i had started the desktop design by creating the top section i.e, heading part after that i had created the four component by using HTML and style them by using CSS. and finally i had created mobile design by using media query.
  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- use of Transform property

### What I learned
I had learned how to arrange many components accordingly and box shadow property and i have to work hard for moving one step further.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on fixed width of an div while using flexbox in future projects. i have learn some further in responsive websites and i have to work more on that. I have to learn other techniques which found useful for me to refine and perfect.
